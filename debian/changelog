flatpak-builder (0.10.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
  * Version the dh-exec build-dependency to (>= 0.23~).
    The version in oldstable doesn't support build profiles. Strictly
    speaking 0.15 might be enough, but I'm not going to test with anything
    older than oldstable-backports.
  * debian/control: Set Rules-Requires-Root: no. This package does not
    contain any file not owned by root.
